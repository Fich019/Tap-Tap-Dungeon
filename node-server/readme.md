# PRCO Node server
This server co-ordinates communication between the web clients and the Unity instances.
- `npm install` to install all dependencies.
- Tested on Ubuntu 16.04
- `cd` into the directory and `node` or `node index.js` to run (or using a process manager like PM2, `pm2 start index.js --name="supine"`)

- Use Node 10.19.0

*Will expand with more information on the scripts soon.*
